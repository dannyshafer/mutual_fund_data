Setting up database:

it has four tables of scraped data: mutual funds, holdings, risks, returns

User input > scraping from google finance > save to database:

it takes a user input to search
it throws an error if the input is not a mutual fund (i.e. if the last character is not 'x')
it scrapes google finance for information about a mutual fund
it stores the results (holdings, risk metrics, returns, morningstar ratings, et al.) in a container array
it takes the results of the container array and stores them in a database which we'll query later

Querying from database:

it has a lot of queries that are my interpretation of the data

Front end:

don't worry about this yet
